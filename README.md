# React.london website static snapshot

This is a snapshot of <https://react.london> and <https://meetup.react.london> created to keep the websites up, but decommission the AWS infrastructure running them.

The snapshot was made manually, and required a fair bit of HTML editing to get it to work.

Original codebase running the site can be found in the [react.london](https://github.com/redbadger/react.london) repo.
